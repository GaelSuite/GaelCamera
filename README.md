Super duper cool tracking stuff >:D

## Overview

In `bot+discanalysisv0.2.py`, I've implemented functionality to capture video, either directly from a camera or from a stored video file. The code displays images or video frames to the user. Object tracking is a key feature, with additional logic to detect contours, which helps in object identification. I've also incorporated color space conversions, for the purpose of filtering or object detection. The code is modular and contains custom-defined functions, loops for iterative operations, and conditional statements for decision-making.

In `heatmap+vectors+arvr.py`, The code captures video and displays the frames or images to the user. I've structured the code in a modular manner, with custom functions, loops for repetitive operations, and conditional statements to handle specific conditions.


---

`csrttracking.py` Within this file, I capture and display video to provide real-time feedback. Object tracking is a significant feature, and the code structure is modular, with custom functions, looping constructs, and conditional statements.


---

In the file `mosetracker.py`, The code can capture video from different sources and display the video frames or images. The code's organization is modular, with custom functions, looping constructs for iterative tasks, and conditional statements for decision-making.


---

`loslesscsrttracking.py` I've implemented video capturing capabilities and display the captured frames or images in real-time. Object tracking and color space conversions are key features in this code. The code is well-organized with custom functions, loops, and conditional statements.


---

In `fairmottrack.py`, The code captures video and displays the content to the user. The structure is modular, with custom functions, loops for iterative tasks, and conditional statements for specific decision-making scenarios.


---

`multitracker.py` I've implemented video capturing functionalities and display mechanisms. The code contains custom functions, iterative loops, and conditional statements to handle various scenarios.


---

Within `multithreadedv0.1.py`, The code captures video and displays the frames or images. I've also introduced threading for concurrent or parallel operations. Object tracking is a prominent feature. The code is modular, with custom functions, loops, and conditional statements.


---

In `optimizedtracker.py`, Video capturing and displaying are core functionalities. Object tracking is a significant feature of this code. The organized structure contains custom-defined functions, looping constructs, and conditional statements.


---

`kcftracking.py` I've incorporated video capturing capabilities and mechanisms to display the video. The code is modular, with custom functions, loops for iterative operations, and conditional statements for decision-making based on specific conditions.
